Hi!

Another great example that nature inspire the design development is what Ryan Hoover and the Baltimore Under Ground Science Space group are developing in bio printing. The researchers have focused on printing with plant cells and genetically engineered bacteria, and they are now exploring various approaches to bio printing, including syringe-based printing of cells suspended in agar, filament-based printing with polycaprolactone, and DLP Stereolithography with photopolymer hydrogels. They also developed a plug-in for Grasshopper called Xylinus. It generates G code directly from Rhino and Grasshopper geometries to 3D printers. The plug-in is named after Glucanobacter xylinus, which produces a fine microbial cellulose fiber that is being studied as a biomaterial with several compelling properties.
