Hi!

This Robotically Fabricated Pavilion In Stuttgart consists in a research project in development by the Institute for Computational Design (ICD) together with the Institute of Building Structures and Structural Design (ITKE) at the University of Stuttgart.  “A key point researched through the project of this pavilion was the possibility of transferring the fibrous morphology of the biological model to fiber-reinforced composite materials, which would lead to new tectonic possibilities in architecture.” In collaboration with biologists, they investigated a great number of different types of invertebrates in order to understand “the material anisotropy and functional morphology of arthropods.” They also considered “the fiber orientation, arrangement and associated layer thickness and stiffness gradients in the exoskeleton of the lobster”. By understanding how the fibrous work in nature, they could build a pavilion “minimizing the material consumption while increasing material efficiency, hierarchy and function integration.” You can find more details about this project [here](http://www.evolo.us/architecture/researching-new-tectonic-possibilities-in-architecture-robotically-fabricated-pavilion-in-stuttgart/).
