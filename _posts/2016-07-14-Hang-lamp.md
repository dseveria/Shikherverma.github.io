In conclusion, with the project Iâ€™ve developed and with the knowledge I acquired studying world spread projects in Biomimicry, I could perceive how beneficial can be the appliance of biology in design and architecture, being the goal to produce smarter design products or even to create a less industrialized and more organic-like environment in human places. The 2016 IIT Digital Fabrication Summer Research turned out to be the space I was seeking to expand my knowledge in Rhino, to learn Grasshopper and to try 3D printing for the first time. 

These are some pictures of the hang version of my light fixture:
