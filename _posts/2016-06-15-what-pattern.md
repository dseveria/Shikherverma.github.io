Hi!

Actually, this was not the last question I ask myself this week. This was the first thing that I worried to solve. Last week, I knew that I was going to use biology as an inspiration to my project, but until the end of our last meeting I couldn’t find a clear direction to follow. Doing some research and going a little back to my high school times, I could find a good inspiration: the epithelial tissue’s disposition of cells. This kind of tissue has seven different types: simple squamous, simple cuboidal, simple columnar, transitional, pseudo stratified columnar, stratified cuboidal and stratified squamous, as you see in the picture. The most interesting disposition is present on the stratified squamous type. There, you can find a clear differentiation between the surface and the most internal part, and this differentiation could be an interesting characteristic to the pattern. Also, this differences in the size and shape of the cells could have an impact on the results of the different machines (laser cutter, 3D printer and CNC) since they all will be using different materials and different techniques to produce the pattern.
