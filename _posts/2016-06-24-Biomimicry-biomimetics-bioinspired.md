Hi!

After midterm review, my project had to be rethought. There was such a confusion in my head about the labels that the act of applying biology concepts in design can have. Biomimicry, biomimetics, bioinspired… There are so many different definitions to an act that seemed the same to me. It turned out that they are not the same. The most curious thing of all this is that it wasn’t just me that was confused about the terms. It’s very common that people cannot define a work as being biomimicry or biomimetics, for example. 
Biomimicry is the most used label nowadays. According to the definition presented by the Biomimicry Institute, “Biomimicry is an approach to innovation that seeks sustainable solutions to human challenges by emulating nature’s time-tested patterns and strategies.”. However, when the focus of the process is not on the sustainable issue, the term biomimetics should be used. Bioinspired is another label related to the process of applying biology concepts to design. It involves designing using the nature as a model of shape. 
Now, I can define my project as being a bioinspired design, which I’m going to detail in the following post.
