Hi!

Though the facebook page StreetArtGlobe, I discovered this amazing tool that allows us to draw on eggs or on any spheric surface, which would be really hard to draw on. According to EggBot [official website](http://egg-bot.com/) "The EggBot software allows you to control the ‘bot from within Inkscape — a superb freeware illustration program — on Mac, Windows, or Linux computers. You can draw an image directly, trace a photograph, or import designs from other programs. You can also control the EggBot directly from many other programs that have the ability to send serial commands over a USB port." You can also create animated drawings that can be seen with the auxilary of a rotation tool as you can see on this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68okad8ddFI).
