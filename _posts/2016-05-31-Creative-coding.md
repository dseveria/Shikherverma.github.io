Hi!

Searching for some new - and possibly crazy - stuff about how digital fabrication could produce art, I found the concept of Creative Coding. This is a form of art expression, in which drawings and images are the final product of coding. In other words, there is no physical paiting or sculpture, but projections that follow a code to behave in some way. According to [DevArt](https://devart.withgoogle.com/#/about), a group of artists that produces art by code, "They use technology as the canvas and code as the raw materials to create innovative, engaging digital art installations." It's a new art movement and a new way to interact with the audience and to express yourself as an artist. It takes the experimental character of the contemporary arts to the extreme and it seems to develop a new art era. You can see an interesting example watching this amazing [video](http://www.pbs.org/video/2322911761/) or you can look and [DevArt productions](https://devart.withgoogle.com/#/about/commissioned-artists).
