Hi!

This week, I went to the Museum on Science and Industry to take a look at the Numbers in Nature exposition. As my theme is going around biomimicry, I thought it would be a great opportunity to revisit this exposition. The exposition is about the ways human creation is similar to – or inspired by – the nature. There, I could see some interesting examples and get inspired by them. At the major room of the expo, I found two great quotes that opened my eyes to a kind of pattern that I had not thought about of working with: the Voronoi pattern. I have a quote from the exposition:

“Voronoi patterns provide clues to nature’s tendency to favor efficiency: the nearest neighbor, shortest path and tightest fit. Each cell in a Voronoi pattern has a seed point. Everything inside a cell is closer to its seed point than to any other seed. The lines between cells are always halfway between neighboring seeds.”

After seeing the examples of patterns from the nature at the museum, I thought it would be interesting to try to make some of them using grasshopper. At home, I started discovering new tools in the plug-in that I had never tried before, and one of those tools was the Voronoi 2D. Using this command associated with others I could produce the box above using plywood 1/8”cut by laser.
