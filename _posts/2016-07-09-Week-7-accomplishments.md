Hi!

This week goals:
1 – Complete grasshopper modeling (shape; pattern)
2 – Complete Rhino modeling (extrusion; mesh)
3 – Complete programming (verify components; do button)
4 – Write paper

This week accomplishments:
1-July to 9-July:
-	Grasshopper modeling complete.
-	Rhino modeling almost complete.
  o	What is missing? Trim intersections of extrusions (faces); Boolean Union (mesh); export to .stl file. 
-	Programming almost complete.
  o	What is missing? When I turn the lights off, one green neopixel turns on (there is no command for green color (0, 255, 0) on my code. I have to solve it with professor’s assistance. 
-	Write paper: Introduction complete. I am also documenting the progress of my project to illustrate my paper.

This week, I also prototyped my project, which I will detail in the following post.

This is a screen shot of when I finished the first phase of modeling with Grasshopper. I generated a group of polysurfaces, which surfaces I worked individually applying the Voronoi pattern using Grasshopper as well.

This is a render of my model after applying the Voronoi pattern in each face. Note that the piece is not extruded yet at this point.
