Hi!

This week assignment was to make a box with some patterns using the plug-in Grasshopper. During the last meeting, we learned how to produce patterns from an image using Grasshopper. At home, I selected some images of patterns to try to manipulate them on Rhino and produce some cool results. I used the example from class as my base file and I edited it to make six different patterns. All of them has different configuration and background image, thatâ€™s why they look like so different. At the end, I chose one pattern to follow and produce my box with only four faces with patterns and two blank ones. On the image above, you can see the patters on plywood. 

In class, I will join the pieces and build the cube.
