Hi!

To build such a complex shape as the shape of the White Royal butterfly’s egg, I’m using Rhinoceros 5.0 and Grasshopper and a list of accomplishments/steps to follow. 
-	The first step is to define the spherical shape with hexagonal faces and pointed finished. 
-	The second step is to apply a Voronoi pattern on each face, which will have a frame to guarantee support for the pattern. The pattern will permit the light to flow from the inside to the outside of the light fixture. 
-	The third step is to build the portion the electronics will occupy, which will also be a base to sustain the spherical object. 
-	The forth step is to program the particle photon and connect the components so they can be placed in their box. 
-	The fifth step is to check the dimensions of the object and then print it. The sixth and last step is to assemble the light fixture and get ready to present it.
