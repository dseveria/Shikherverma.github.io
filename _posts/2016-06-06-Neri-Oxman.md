Hi!

I just watched this [TED presentation of Neri Oxman](https://www.ted.com/talks/neri_oxman_design_at_the_intersection_of_technology_and_biology#t-302558), an Israeli architect that is well known by combining design and biology. She commands a group of researchers interested in creating design with what the environment can provide. She presented some very different projects, involving management of the growth of colony of bacteria, synthesizing new biological paths. Those examples are, of course, way better developed than my project will be, but it surely works as a great inspiration to all students that desires to understand the possibilities of design nowadays.
