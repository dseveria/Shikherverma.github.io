Hi!

Do you know that a laser cutter can do much more than cut and engrave things on a material using its the same funcions? The LAserOrigami project, developed by [Hasso Plattner Institut](http://hpi.de/baudisch/projects/laserorigami.html), shows that this machine can cut and folder a box without any human help. It's not like 3D printing a complex object, it cannot produce big objects apparently, but it can produce home and office supplies - like pen holders - with no human interference during the cutting process. To understand how it works, see this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arjRtCjI9AQ). This [PDF file](http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/2570000/2567782/p36-mueller.pdf?ip=104.194.98.197&id=2567782&acc=ACTIVE%20SERVICE&key=50864D773CC43BF0%2E50864D773CC43BF0%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35&CFID=793439423&CFTOKEN=94792278&__acm__=1464761477_fc2af28afcd9f2a8ab71e8d0a248e5b1) has also many detailed information about the process.
