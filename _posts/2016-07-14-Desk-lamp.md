During the IIT 2016 Summer Digital Fabrica on Research, I studied the concepts and applica ons of biology in the design process in order to develop a bioinspired project. As the final project, I developed a hang light fixture bioinspired by the White Royal Bu erflyâ€™s egg, which has a very complex shape that could be reproduced with 3D prin ng. The light fixture was completely digital fabricated, using Rhinoceros 5.0 and Grasshopper to be designed; the Z Corpora on Zprinter 450 to be conceived; and a Par cle Photon to get working. In this paper, there are more detailed informa on about the concept, design and results of the project, including pictures, screen shots of the process and codes.

These are some pictures of the desk version of my light fixture:
