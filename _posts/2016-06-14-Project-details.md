Hi!

My project consists in three steps: experimenting, modeling and printing. In the experiment phase, I will build a sand box where volunteers will play with in order to produce images to be captured by a Kinect positioned on the top of the sand box and connected with Grasshopper. The images will represent the state of the sand at the time of the capture, representing regions of more or less material. Based on the results of the first phase, I will model a nature-based pattern, which is going be an interception between mimicking what exists in nature and following the points generated on Grasshopper with the experiment. The result will be – ideally – printed in 3D, laser cut and cut using the CNC machine. The idea is to see different results of the same pattern using different materials and techniques, which will be defined by the machine that is going to be used.
