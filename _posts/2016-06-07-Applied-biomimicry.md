One example of how Biomimicry can be applied in design is the technology Qualcomm’s Mirasol display, which consists in a display that uses the environmental light – sunlight or artificial light – to send back a color image. It is an economic solution to displays, since it does not consume as much energy as the traditional LCD displays because it does not need to use the power from the batteries to produce light. The point is: how is it related to biology? The technology was actually inspired by the color of the butterflies’ wings. I will use a quote from a [Smithsonian article]( http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/how-biomimicry-is-inspiring-human-innovation-17924040/#UpVfl9ooKJfZJ1hR.99) to tell you the history of this technology. 

“More than a decade ago, an MIT grad named Mark Miles was dabbling in the field of micro-electromechanical and materials processing. As he paged through a science magazine, he was stopped by an article on how butterflies generate color in their wings. The brilliant iridescent blue of the various Morpho species, for example, comes not from pigment, but from “structural color.”” “(…) Where else might you want incredibly vivid color in a thin package? Of course: in an electronic device display. Qualcomm, which acquired the company Miles had formed to develop the technology, used it in its Mirasol display.” “Like the butterfly’s wings, ‘the display is taking the white ambient light around us, white light or sunlight, and through interference is going to send us back a color image,’ Gally says. Unlike conventional LCD screens, the Mirasol doesn’t have to generate its own light. ‘The display brightness just automatically scales with ambient light.’ As a result, the Mirasol consumes a tenth of the power of an LCD reader. Qualcomm used the display in an e-reader and is offering it for license to other companies.”
