Hi!

As I said in the last post, my project is now defined as a bioinspired design. As the term suggest, I’m going to design an object inspired by something in nature. My object will be a light fixture, which is going to use a particle photon to work. My inspiration is the shape of the White Royal butterfly’s egg (as you can see in the picture). In terms of geometry, the egg has a spherical shape composed by hexagonal faces and pointed finishes. This shape is going to be the main part of the light fixture, where neopixels will be placed. The project will be printed in 3D to be presented on July 14th.
