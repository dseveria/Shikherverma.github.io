Hi!

With last week research, I found an interest in myself by pieces of design that are in some way inspired by the natural environment. That’s Biomimicry. I didn’t know very well what this term means, so I decided to search a little about its definition. On an article about how biomimicry is inspiring human innovation – on the [Smithsonian website]( http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/how-biomimicry-is-inspiring-human-innovation-17924040/#UpVfl9ooKJfZJ1hR.99) – I found some quotes that really helped me to understand what is actually biomimicry. 

“This is the idea behind the increasingly influential discipline of biomimicry: that we human beings, who have been trying to make things for only the blink of an evolutionary eye, have a lot to learn from the long processes of natural selection, whether it’s how to make a wing more aerodynamic or a city more resilient or an electronic display more vibrant.”

“Biomimicry isn’t itself a product but a process, drawing on natural organisms and processes in order to spark innovation. Organizations and even cities can look to ecosystems for inspiration, says Tim McGee, a biologist and member of Biomimicry 3.8, a Montana-based consultancy.”
