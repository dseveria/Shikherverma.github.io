Hi!

As I said on the last post, last Thursday I 3D printed one piece of my design to test its resistance. 
First, I printed it in the plastic machine using a Voronoi pattern with 2mm of thickness, then I printed it in the plaster machine using a Voronoi with 1mm of thickness. Unfortunately, I dropped down the piece printed in the ZPrinter (plaster machine) right after printing it (before immerging it in super glue), so I lost this example. However, before broking it, I could perceive that 1mm could make my entire model very fragile – even after the glue -, so I decided to use 1.5mm of thickness and to print my model on the plaster machine, because: 1) it prints in less time; 2) it costs less; 3) it doesn’t have the layered finish that I could see in the plastic piece; 4) at the end, my piece will not be bright white, it will have a more organic color; 5) I can print my entire piece at once, so I don’t need to worry about joints and time to assemble it.

This is a picture of what I prepared to be printed in plastic.

This is the result of the plastic printing.

This is a detail of the surface of the plastic prototype.
