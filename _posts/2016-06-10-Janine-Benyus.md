Hi!

On this week research, trying to find about the actors of bio design and biomimetics nowadays, I found the Biomimicry Institute, which has good content to aware people about the importance of using biology in the design process. They emphasize that “A sustainable world already exists” and motivate us to take a look in what the genius of the nature already did before trying to create any revolutionary solution to human problems. According to the institution, “(…) nature has already solved many of the problems we are grappling with. Animals, plants, and microbes are the consummate engineers. After billions of years of research and development, failures are fossils, and what surrounds us is the secret to survival.” This new concept of biomimetics inspired me to write about why bio design can be better than the traditional one, which is going to be part of my final paper. 

On the same institution, I could get to known Janine Benyus, a biologist that propagates the idea that we should learn from the genius that surround us, and who is also the co-founder of Biomimicry 3.8, the world’s best in biomimicry innovation consulting, training for professionals, and curricula development for educators. According to her, “When we look at what is truly sustainable, the only real model that has worked over long periods of time is the natural world.” I could also learn very much about the issue watching her [TED talk about biomimicry in action](https://www.ted.com/talks/janine_benyus_biomimicry_in_action).
