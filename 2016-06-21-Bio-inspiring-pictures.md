Hi!

We can see nature all around us. There are plants, animals, bacteria, viruses, fungi, etc. everywhere. But the way the 2015 Nikon Smalls World’s winners see the nature is much more interesting. With these and other pictures that you can find [here](http://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2015/10/nikon-small-world-2015/410548/), we can see that all living beings can be more complex that they seem like. Some of them have very attractive colors, shapes and textures. These features could inspire a piece of furniture, a sculpture, a painting. Why not architecture, right? My project now focuses on the aesthetic of the nature and the appliance of this feature in architecture. My favorite pictures are below:
